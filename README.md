# word.md (working title)

## Project Description
This is application is similar to Microsoft Word in that it allows the user to create markdown files without having to know the markdown syntax. Users will be able to view two documents at the same time that represent the same file, one raw file with markdown syntax and one preview file to preview the compiled markdown file. Users will be able to type on both documents to their preference. The features of how you can edit the markdown file will be available at the top of the application where you can select different things you want to do such as bold, italicize, select heading styles similar to Word. For example, if the user types in “Hello World” and clicks the header 6 feature on the preview doc, the raw doc will change what the user typed into markdown syntax of “###### Hello World”. Users will be able to download the .md file for their use, our goal is to provide a markdown file compatible with GitHub.

## Project Relevance
This application is relevant to our class because it is a test-driven and debugging based project to ensure all features work in all possible use cases. The application will require parallel computing because the features themselves do not depend on each other. Features can be developed independently which will be easier for testing and debugging. We would also need to use XML because our application depends on working around a defined set of pre-existing rules because we need to support markdown. Lastly, since our project is an application, we will need to develop a GUI. This project will obviously include version control and project management for consistency among all the developers involved.

## Project Contribution
Our project requires the following technical skills: Java, JavaScript, CSS, and GUI interface knowledge for the creation and design of the features and application. We will use Java to develop the backend of our project which will include the development of all the features and modes we offer to our users. I’ve found an implementation of the how to compile a preview for the raw markdown file which we can incorporate into the application.  This implementation is done using JavaScript and CSS which we need to understand and adapt to our project. Lastly, the frontend of the GUI will be designed using Scene Builder. Scene Builder is an UI development application that works seamlessly with Java. The goal is to include all basic features of the markdown language specifically things like bold, italicize, headers, and lists. These features will have to be implemented seamlessly on-click similar to the way a word is bolded when you click the bold button in word.
